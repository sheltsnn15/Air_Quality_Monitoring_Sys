## 1. Overview of SCD4x CO2 Sensor

The SCD4x CO2 sensor is a device that measures carbon dioxide concentration, relative humidity, and temperature. It uses the I2C communication protocol to interact with microcontrollers or other devices.

## 2. I2C Communication Protocol

I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) is a serial communication protocol that allows multiple devices to communicate with each other using just two wires: a clock line (SCL) and a data line (SDA). The SCD4x sensor acts as an I2C slave, responding to commands and providing data to the I2C master (e.g., a microcontroller).

## 3. Common Terminology

Before we delve into the commands and descriptions, let's understand some common terminology used in this guide:

- **Word**: A word is a 16-bit data unit, which consists of two bytes.
- **CRC Checksum**: The CRC-8 checksum is an 8-bit value used for data integrity verification.
- **Response Parameter**: The data or information returned by the sensor after receiving a specific command.
- **Max. Command Duration**: The maximum time it takes for the sensor to process a specific command.

## 4. I2C Commands and Descriptions

The following sections provide an overview of various I2C commands used to interact with the SCD4x CO2 sensor.

### 4.1 Initialization and Measurement Commands

#### 4.1.1 Start Periodic Measurement

**Description**: This command starts the continuous measurement of CO2 concentration, relative humidity, and temperature.

**Command**: Write 0x21B1 (hexadecimal)

**Max. Command Duration**: 2100 ms

### 4.1.2 Stop Measurement

**Description**: This command stops the continuous measurement.

**Command**: Write 0x3F86 (hexadecimal)

**Max. Command Duration**: 0 ms (immediate response)

### 4.1.3 Read Measurement Data

**Description**: This command reads the CO2 concentration, relative humidity, and temperature measurement data from the sensor.

**Command**: Write 0xEC05 (hexadecimal)

**Wait 1 ms Command Execution Time**

**Response**: CO2 concentration, Relative humidity, and Temperature data in words.

### 4.2 Automatic Self-Calibration (ASC) Commands

#### 4.2.1 Perform Forced Recalibration

**Description**: This command performs a forced recalibration of the sensor to adjust the CO2 concentration readings.

**Command**: Write 0x362F (hexadecimal)

**Input Parameter**: Target CO2 concentration

**Response Parameter**: FRC-correction

**Max. Command Duration**: 400

 ms

#### 4.2.2 Enable/Disable ASC

**Description**: This command enables or disables the Automatic Self-Calibration (ASC) feature of the sensor.

**Command**: Write 0x2416 (hexadecimal) for enable, 0x241D (hexadecimal) for disable

**Max. Command Duration**: 100 ms

### 4.3 Advanced Features

The advanced features of the SCD4x CO2 sensor include persisting settings, getting the serial number, performing self-tests, factory reset, and reinitialization. For detailed descriptions of these features and their respective commands, refer to sections 3.9 and 3.10 in the original document.

## 5. Checksum Calculation

The SCD4x CO2 sensor uses an 8-bit CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) checksum to ensure data integrity. The CRC-8 properties and example code for checksum calculation are provided in Table 30 of the original document.

## 6. Example Code (C/C++) for CRC Checksum Generation

The original document includes example code in C/C++ for generating the CRC-8 checksum. Refer to the code snippet provided in the document for guidance.
